## Introduction: The Universe as Becoming—Proposing an Emergent Framework

This paper proposes a new framework for understanding the universe not as a mere static aggregation of spatial and material structures, but as a dynamic unfolding of emergence, relationship, and order. Central to this framework is the concept of "emergence," defined as a phenomenon in which interactions among multiple elements produce holistic structures and meanings that cannot be predicted solely from the properties of individual components. Emergence serves as a universal foundational concept across natural sciences, philosophy, and religious thought.

The discussion in this paper revolves around the following core questions:

- What is time—how do irreversibility and sequential order of changes arise?
- Under what generative conditions do active structures such as will and creativity emerge?
- How should we understand the relationship between non-stationarity, entropy increase, and the formation of order?
- How is human creative activity positioned within the universe's emergent nature?

These inquiries are essential for rethinking the generative nature of the universe and serve as guiding principles for this paper. Furthermore, the subject extends beyond theoretical exploration, deeply rooted in the existential concern of understanding what meaning and role humans, as beings who experience suffering, hold within this emergent cosmos.

## Section 1: The Universe as Becoming

The universe is not a static stage but a continuously evolving structure. Since the Big Bang, fundamental particles have formed atoms and stars, continuously creating new orders through cycles of explosions and fusion. This process is driven by the integration of matter, energy, spatial geometry, randomness, and fluctuations.

Emergence does not represent merely the sum of parts but signifies phenomena where meaning and function arise from relationality itself. The universe is thus a field of emergent relationships, possessing an inherently "verbal essence."

## Section 2: What is Time?—Traces and Sequential Ordering of Change

Time is nothing but the recognition of traces left by emergent structures and the sequential order in which they occur. To perceive time, three conditions must be met: firstly, change must be irreversible; secondly, the outcomes of change must persist as traces; thirdly, these traces must be recognized in a comparable sequential order.

In this sense, without "records" or "traces," time cannot be perceived or defined. For example, in a perfectly balanced universe with no changes or traces left behind, one would find no means of recognizing the flow of time.

Time manifests through the directional accumulation of emergent structures aligned with increasing entropy. Energy dissipation, local formation of order, and information accumulation serve as markers of time's "flow."

Thus, time and emergence share a complementary and inseparable relationship. Without emergence, time holds no trace and remains merely an abstract concept; without time, emergence degenerates into isolated phenomena without structural or meaningful continuity.

Therefore, time and emergence exist in a non-dual relationship. Although commonly discussed separately, they represent different aspects of a singular phenomenon, forming an inseparable, co-dependent structure within the "universe of becoming."

## Section 3: Non-stationarity and Creativity—The Principle of Explosive Structuring

Emergent changes frequently occur in non-stationary and nonlinear ways. Cellular differentiation, fluid vortices, urban formation, chemical oscillations, and flashes of insight illustrate how new order emerges when information and energy surpass certain thresholds.

This non-stationarity forms the foundation for unpredictability and creativity, defining the universe as perpetually generating novel structures rather than repeating identical forms—this is the essential nature of the emergent universe.

## Section 4: The Emergence of Will—From Pure Experience to Structure

Will emerges as a directional, emergent structure arising from fragmented pure experiences such as sensations, memories, intuitions, and emotions through resonance, interference, and integration. Thus, will is not an independent decision-making subject but a relational structure enabling choices.

Consequently, will should be understood strictly as an "inner emergence."

## Section 5: From Being Created to Creating

Humans are "created beings" resulting from adaptive evolution and mutation. However, this fact does not render humans purely passive. Instead, humans undergo self-transformation into "creating beings" through capacities such as self-awareness, recording, symbolic representation, and structural organization.

This transformation represents not merely the expression of capabilities but the emergence of a structure by which the universe recursively generates itself. Thus, the universe has internally produced a subject capable of questioning its own meaning, a self-contained evolutionary structure requiring no external teleology or creator.

Significantly, human creative activities are self-referential but not closed systems, aligning with Gödel's incompleteness theorem. No formal system can entirely describe its totality, compelling continuous self-extension and redefinition.

Thus, "creating beings" are not merely following external directives but function as catalysts leveraging inherent structural inconsistencies and limitations to generate new meaning and order. This recursive emergence embodies humanity’s unique role within the dynamic totality of the universe.

Consequently, the phrase "from being created to creating" transcends evolutionary facts, signifying an internal structural leap within a self-generative universe. Here, the universe emerges as a continuous chain of self-generated meaning without external purpose or designer.

## Section 6: Suffering and Emergence—Beyond Expedients to Buddhahood

Suffering arises from internal tension as structures attempt to maintain homeostasis. The Buddha's teachings of the "Four Noble Truths" link suffering to resistance to change, the mind's reluctance to structural transformation.

The Lotus Sutra classifies the extinction of suffering as an expedient means, pointing toward a deeper truth. The "Life Span of the Thus Come One" reveals that the Buddha attained enlightenment eternally in the distant past, indicating Buddhahood as an eternal emergent essence. This suggests identity between emergence and Buddha-nature.

Thus, suffering constitutes the threshold of emergence, the critical juncture for structural leaps. Precisely because suffering exists, creation becomes possible, imparting meaning to life.

The Mahayana tradition's Six Paramitas involve not denying or merely enduring suffering but actively generating new relational orders through compassionate actions—a truly emergent Bodhisattva practice. Within an emergent cosmos, such relational creativity embodies essential reality and manifests wisdom as Buddha-nature.

## Section 7: Hierarchical Model of Emergence—Mapping the Cosmic Chain

To grasp the emergent universe, it is necessary to understand phenomena not as chaotic diversities but as layered sequences of order. Emergence in the universe is simultaneously an infinite chain and observable in several distinct, phase-transition-like hierarchies:

1. **Physical Emergence:** Energy → Particles → Atoms → Stars and Galaxies

This level involves the intersection of forces and fields, shaping energy into spatial and material structures. Universal laws such as gravitation, electromagnetism, and quantum fluctuations drive fundamental structural formation. Here, emergence manifests as "form generation through field integration."

2. **Biological Emergence:** Molecules → Cells → Organisms → Ecosystems

At this level, replication and adaptation of information enable structures to maintain themselves and respond to their environments. DNA, metabolism, and immune systems exemplify emergence through "stabilization via self-organization and replication," marking the stage at which information acquires meaning.

3. **Mental Emergence:** Sensations → Memories → Will → Self

Experiences accumulate, and perception integrates with memory, forming a directional sense of self. Will arises as a structured integration of pure experiences (as discussed in Section 4). Emergence here functions as "the formation of self through experiential organization."

4. **Spiritual Emergence:** Empathy → Compassion → Buddha-nature → Bodhisattva Action

This level transcends boundaries of self and other, enabling practical actions that exceed personal confines. The creative transformation of suffering (as discussed in Section 6) acts as a "circuit linking self, others, and the universe," revealing truth through relationality.

These four hierarchical levels do not represent linear developmental stages but interact reciprocally, forming a nonlinear network. Will (third level), for instance, continually influences and is influenced by physical constraints (first level) and emotional conditions (second level). Conversely, spiritual practice (fourth level) is projected back onto the mental level, reshaping bodily and behavioral patterns.

This hierarchical model aligns with Buddhism’s Five Aggregates—form (physical emergence), sensation and perception (mental emergence), volitional formations, and consciousness (spiritual emergence)—representing the dynamic totality of universal emergence. Humans serve as the intersection point across these hierarchies, mediating vertical emergent chains and embodying suffering and potential, continually re-creating themselves.

## Supplement: Whitehead and Huayan—Eastern and Western Emergent Philosophies

Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy, emphasizing "actual occasions," remarkably resonates with Huayan Buddhism’s "interpenetration of phenomena without obstruction" (shishi wu'ai fajie). Both perspectives conceive reality not as discrete objects but as relational networks, forming a philosophical foundation bridging Eastern and Western thought within emergent cosmology.

## Conclusion: Our Place in the Emergent Universe

Significant questions remain unresolved:
- How do values emerge within emergent processes?
- Can cosmic self-organization inherently embody ethical direction?

These questions may not have definitive answers. However, the human enterprise of generating new meaning and order amid suffering and relationality represents the continuous emergence of value.

Even if the universe emerges from blind forces, the intentional weaving of meaning allows humans to exist as "creating beings." This perspective, especially in tumultuous times, can serve as a small beacon of hope and pride for those who struggle.

## Epilogue

On our journey to understand the emergent cosmos, we sometimes encounter moments of ineffable gratitude, whether through compassionate gazes, selfless acts, or quiet empathy for the wounded.

Tears elicited by encountering compassion may precede rational explanation, suggesting the universe communicates profoundly to us. Compassion represents a miraculous relational order reconnecting self and others at emergence's deepest level. It is registered within our inner world through gratitude.

We may never "reach" the ultimate truth of the universe. Yet moments of compassionate tears may bring us closest to its genuine essence.
